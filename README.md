This project is an undertaking to create a complete
food distribution setup to the likes of Zomato and
Swiggy on a very small scale.The main highlights include
account organisation,ordering of food, creating a
storable bill and assigning a delivery boy to the order.
First, the user would have to enter account credentials
and gain access, following which he would be given a
menu for ordering food.After ordering food, he would be
provided with a bill for his order and also a feedback
option would be presented.
Then depending upon his order and available delivery
men, time for delivery would be notified.
